Hello,

my name is Nabe Gewell, I'm the CEO of Microtrans Games. My CTO, Cohn Jarmack. recommended you to me for having an impressive track record of saving sinking ships, if you know what I mean. Perhaps you can help us with our little problem here. In fact, a some time ago I hired a group of top talent to work on our new game, Ryskim. Despite paying them a fortune (like nearly a third of what our marketing people and controllers earn), they completely messed up. 
I'll give you access to the codebase Ada Typical, Bilbo Bellic and Cro Magnon wrote.

Specifically, those are the issues I'd like you to look into:

1)
A. Typical was tasked with the most important aspect of the game - the copy protection. My CTO told me she was using a mechanism which was used two decades ago. And I'm also worried that the implementation itself might also be subpar. Could you check if it's possible to circumvent the copy protection in two cases:

1.1) The user has access to the binary (but not the source code).
1.2) The user does not have access to the binary, like when running on a protected system like on console, or some streaming mechanism.
